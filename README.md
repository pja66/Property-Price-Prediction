# Property Price Prediction
Philip Ayoub (pja66) and Kevin Cushing (kxc4)

This project is base on the Kaggle competition:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data.

We will attempt to predict the sale price of housing properties based on 
information about the property using machine learning methods. This dataset has 
some incomplete/missing information so we will also heavily use imputation and 
feature engineering. The train and test data sets for the Kaggle competition 
are from a select range of times and only for properties in Ames, IA. We will 
first train a model to perform on properties from the given timeframe in Ames 
and then attempt to predict prices across different subsets of years.
